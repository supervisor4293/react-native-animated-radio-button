## Credits

This library is heavily inspired on [react-native-radio-button](https://github.com/mmazzarolo/react-native-radio-button)
It is re-written with a modern way. Also it has **built-in selection system**.
The library itself also has a bouncy animation when onPress is triggered.

## Future Plans

- [x] ~~LICENSE~~
- [ ] Left, right, bottom text component as optional
- [ ] Write an article about the lib on Medium
